# Face-Mask-Detection-using-MobileNET
This Python code demonstrates image classification using MobileNetV2 with transfer learning.
It uses TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building, training, and evaluating the model. The code includes data preprocessing steps, data augmentation, and splitting the dataset. It trains the model, saves the best weights, and evaluates the performance. Plots for accuracy and loss are generated. The code can be customized for different datasets and classification tasks. It provides a starting point for image classification using transfer learning.
#Also from the directories, dataset is attached to it and also a code for testing the code 

Feel free to use and modify it to work on different images dataset
